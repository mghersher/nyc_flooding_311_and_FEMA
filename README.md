Pull, clean, and analyze data from NYC's 311 complaints and FEMA's flood hazard boundaries to tackle common flooding misconceptions

This repository contains the notebooks used to process raw data from FEMA's website and NYC's Open Data Portal. The resulting spatial statistics, shapefiles, and images were combined into an [ESRI StoryMap](https://arcg.is/HLfnv0) that challenges the conception that flooding only affects vulnerable coastlines and areas battered by unprecedented storms.
